The SUPReMM architecture comprises three major components.
   
* Software that runs directly on HPC compute nodes and periodically collects performance information.
* Software that uses the node-level performance data to generate job-level data.
* An Open XDMoD module that enables the job-level information to be viewed and analysed.

The Open XDMoD module is designed to support the ingestion and display of job-level performance data
from a variety of sources including [PCP](http://pcp.io), Cray RUR and [tacc_stats](https://github.com/TACC/tacc_stats).
The recommended data collection software is PCP and the supported job summarization software is listed below.

### Open XDMoD
